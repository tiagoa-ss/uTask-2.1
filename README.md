## Installation

In order to run this app properly, you should have an account in [Mongo DB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and:
- create a new cluster;
- click on the connect button and follow the steps;
- for secutiry reasons, the code has an file named '.env.example', complete the fields with your information gathered from MongoDB Atlas, username and password, then rename the file as '.env';
- Remember to run your backend folder with 'yarn dev'
- Same for the frontend with 'yarn dev'
